As an open source contributor, enhanced Blender (3D OSS) across four major release cycles (versions 3.0 to 3.3) bydelivering critical features and resolving high-impact bugs, directly improving functionality and user experience.

Boosted performance by optimizing GLSL shaders and integrating custom overlay rendering, resulting in a significant 20% improvement in UI responsiveness for the 2D workspace and accelerating texture mapping tools.

Resolved a decade-old design flaw in the BMesh API (Blenderâ€™s internal 3D topology data structure) by
rewriting the low-level selection logic in C, introducing edge selection support in the UV editor, and effectively addressing a backlog of critical user issues.
