This project is a lightweight neural network framework focused on linear layers, implemented in C++ with support for CUDA to enable GPU-based computations. It includes core components such as tensors, linear layers, optimizers, and loss functions. The framework uses a computational graph for efficient gradient computation and backpropagation. With Python bindings via Pybind11, users can integrate it seamlessly into Python workflows.
