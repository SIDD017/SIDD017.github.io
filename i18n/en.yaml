  translation:  <p class="lead">
      I am an engineer by formation, curious and energetic - that applies technology to solve real-world 
      problems. Personally, I’m a very easy going, sociable, fast-learner, curious and natural leader. I 
      do what I love, and I love what I do. I lead by example and work side by side with my teams.   
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
      I am a deliberate jack of all trades, master of none. My profile is a hybrid of technical and 
      managerial experience, but always related to technological projects. I bring business and product 
      vision to tech teams, partly thanks to having started an developed a company. I am a fast learner, 
      curious to see how technology can improve the users experience in multiple areas. I have a strong 
      motivation and sense of responsibility with myself, my team and clients (or peers), and people like 
      my positive and easy going, can-do attitude.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    On the technical side, I’m a specialized generalist, always working between different areas and aiming to develop a holistic vision on what is involved into creating a successful tech product - mobile and web development, devops/SRE,... This has involved a variety of languages and frameworks in the web-side, both in the backend and in the client side.
